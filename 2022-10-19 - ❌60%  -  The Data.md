### What is a dataset?
A dataset is a collection of data related to some specific information.
We can represent data in two ways:
- __Tabular data__: easiest way of representing data, using rows and columns.
- __Untabular data__: al the rest. 

Unrelated: CSV is a dataset type, and stands for _comma-separated values_.

### Issues on data
Some issues on data are:
- __Type__: can be qualitative (non-number) or quantitative (number), or structured. 
- __Quality__: we have to consider the quality of data. 
	- In the process of representing reality with data, we may make mistake. It is in relation to how data is _collected_.
	- The better the quality, the better result from machine learning
	- Some mining techniques are better than others (some data collecting processes are also more prone to error).
- _Pre-processing_ (or preprocess) is the activity of modifying data to ease mining activities. So it is done before the "real" machine learning. 

### Data Types and numerical properties

This table is pretty important:
![[data_type_table.png]]

A little precisation:
- Ratio values: they are similar to interval values, but they are in relation of something with an absolute and unique reference (of 0). i.e. Kelvin temperatures, which can't go below 0.  

> [!Note]
>In this table, the ''description'' and ''descriptive statistics'' columns are incremental, i.e. the properties described in the row are added to the other properties describe above.  

Here's an example:
![[example_data_types.png]]
- Column patient is a _nominal_ value. It can also be seen as an identifier, but are not useful for machine learning, but only to connect tables in the relational model. 
- Treatment is a _nominal_ value. In this case, it is not important the order of values. 

# Allowed Transformation
This table is a companion to the previous one: 
![[allowed_transformations_on_data.png]]
Some notes:
- in an ordinal value, ...
[2, 3:11]
# Number of values
The number of discrete values is the number of rows. 

Continuos domains are typical represented as floating point variables.

Examples:
- Nominals and ordinals are discrete
- Intervals and ratio are continuos
- Counts are discrete and ratio type. 

### Asymmetric attributes
Only presence is considered important (a non-null value)

## General characteristics of data sets
- __Dimensionality__:
- __Sparsity__: when there are many missing values (zeros or nulls).
- Beware the _nulls in disguise_: a widespread bad habit is to store zero or some special value when a piece information is not available. 
- Resolution
	- Random variation that should not influence our reason. 

How to record data?
- Tables: i.e. relation
- Transction: a row is composed by: TID + set of Items
- Data matrix: like tables, but all the columns are numbers. 
- Sparse data matrix: asymmetric values of the same type
-
