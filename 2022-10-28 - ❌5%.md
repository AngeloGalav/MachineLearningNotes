### The meaning of _test error_.
Let us suppone that the tesst set is a good representation, on the average, of the entire dataset $X$.

Statistical pruning with error estimation
Essentially, we there are tools that can tell us if we should prune a tree and how to do it. So let's consider a decision tree, and let's focus on the leaves.

What does it mean in practice?
That the bigger number of the tree is small. So, it maybe the case that if I prune part of the tree, the pessimistic error frequency is smaller. 

If I have a small dataset perhaps it doesn't work very well, and for this reason many use this to decide if we should prune or not. 


### Binary prediction

We may have a bad prediction
and those are the bad predictions. A typical way of resolving this is through the confusion matrix .

With each label we should see counts or frequencies. 

We can compute the accuracy as $$
\dfrac{TP + TN}{N_{tests}} 
$$
Is the accuracy the only performance indicator for a classifier? No, we have also:
- Velocity 
- Robustness w.r.t. noise i.e. training data with bad class label 
- Scalability 
- Interpretability: a decision tree has good interpretability since we see a clear path of the decision since we have a sequence of clear tests and we can come to a conclusion.

Errors are false positives and false negatives, but it maybe the case that false negatives have worse consequences than false positives. 

Here are also some aspects that we can measure:
- _Precision_ = $TP/(TP + FP)$, it is the rate of true positives. 
- _Recall_ = $TP/(TP + FN)$ , it is the complementary of the precision. i.e. the number of positives that I can catch (a.k.a. Sensitivity). 
- _Specificity_ = $TN/(TN  + FP)$ the rate of the negatives that I can catch. 

F1 score is given by the __harmonic mean__ of precision and recall:
$$
F1\_score = 2\dfrac{prec \cdot rec}{prec + rec}
$$
It is a value between 0 and 1. It increases when precision and recall are __balanced__.
It is usually interesting when we want to find hte best compromise between precision and recall.

## Beyond accuracy
Is it likely to obtain a correct prediction by chance?
