# Notes and exercises on Machine Learning        

## What is this?
This repository contains all the material that I've used to study for the Machine Learning course in the MSc in AI @ UniBo (2022/2023).
It contains a series of complete and comprehensive notes on ML, which explain the main techniques in Classification, Clustering, Association rules, etc.  
In the near future, this repository will contain some solutions to the exercises in the previous exams, as well as code templates to use during the exam.   

I believe that the material in here __can be very useful to anyone__, not just students of this course. 

For the first time ever, the notes are all written in pure English.

### Why would I read this?
The notes in here are taken lesson by lesson, and are basically a _transcript_ of everything the professor has said during the course.
I firmly believe that the notes in here can be used as a way to __fully study__ this course. 

There are many features that may ease the process of learning this topics, such as:
- Syntax highlighting for important words and concepts.
- Transcription of additional useful information told during the lessons.  
- Explanations of images.     
- Shortcuts to previously mentioned topics. 
- And much more... 

## How to use the notes
All the notes are written in __Obsidian Markdown__, but will be rendered to PDF in the near future. To read this properly, you'll need to import this repository as a vault 
in Obsidian, which is pretty easy to do. I think this notes are best read on a laptop or tablet in the Obsidian app.     

## Tasks
- [x] Write all notes
- [ ] Render notes in PDF
- [ ] Add Lab solutions
- [ ] Add solutions to past exams
- [ ] Add templates
- [ ] Add "digests" of the notes (a summary basically)

## How can I contribute?
You can open a PR to:
- Correct any errors in the notes. 
- Correct any errors in the code or add comments.
- Complete any of the unfinished tasks. 

Alternatively, you can write an email to the address in my profile page.  

If you find these notes useful, please consider starring these repository :smile:.
